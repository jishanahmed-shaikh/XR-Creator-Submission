## Project Overview

This Unity project is built for XR submission, featuring innovative AR solutions:

### 1. Markerless AR CAR (Pocket Showroom)
We have developed a markerless AR experience using Vuforia and Unity, allowing users to:
- Select their preferable car and place it in the real world.
- Customize the car's color.
- Interact with car doors and interior.

### 2. AR GPS Navigation
An AR-based navigation system offering:
- Real-time dashboard display with distance and directional guidance (e.g., right, left, etc.).
- Detailed area information displayed within the AR interface.
- Directions seamlessly integrated into the real-world view.

The AR navigation is designed to work by placing your phone inside your car, providing an immersive and intuitive driving assistant.
